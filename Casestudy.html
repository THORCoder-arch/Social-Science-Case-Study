        <h1 class="title">A Case Study on Rural Administration and Livelihoods</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Name: Abhi Sasmal &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; Grade and Division: Grade 6MC &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; Completed on: 22-01-25</p>

        <div id="village" class="section">
            <h2>1. Name and Location of the Village</h2>
            <p>I have chosen Khireshwar, Maharashtra. Khireshwar is famous primarily because it serves as the base village for the popular "Harishchandragad trek" in Maharashtra, India, which is renowned for its challenging terrain, historical significance, and stunning views, with the "Nageshwar temple" in Khireshwar itself being a key point of interest due to its ancient carvings that indicate the fort's medieval age.

        <div id="administration" class="section">
            <h2>2. Administration</h2>
            <p>Khireshwar is governed by the Gram Panchayat, which manages local administration and development. Decisions are made through community meetings with active participation from villagers. Key services include maintaining roads, managing water supply, and supporting education through local schools. Initiatives like the Jal Jeevan Mission aim to improve water access, but challenges like limited resources and connectivity persist.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="livelihood" class="section">
            <h2>3. Livelihood</h2>
            <p>The primary sources of income in Khireshwar are agriculture, animal husbandry, and tourism. Villagers grow seasonal crops like rice and wheat, relying heavily on rainfall, while some earn from rearing cattle and poultry. Tourism related to Harishchandragad Fort provides seasonal income through guiding, food services, and accommodations. However, challenges such as unreliable water supply, limited employment opportunities, and poor infrastructure hinder consistent earnings. Traditional practices like organic farming, crafting handicrafts, and using herbal remedies add uniqueness to their livelihoods. Despite these efforts, many villagers migrate to cities for additional income due to limited local opportunities.

        <div id="reflections" class="section">
            <h2>4. Reflections</h2>
            <p>From this task, I learned about the unique lifestyle and challenges of rural villages like Khireshwar. It was interesting to see how the villagers balance traditional livelihoods, such as organic farming and herbal remedies, with opportunities from tourism. Though it has limited resources, the Gram Panchayat plays a vital role in local governance, emphasizing community participation. The efforts to improve water supply through initiatives like the Jal Jeevan Mission also highlight the importance of sustainable development in remote areas.
